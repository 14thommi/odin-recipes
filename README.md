## Reflection
After creating this project I can confidently say I know how to create HTML boilerplate for scratch and have the ability to write basic blogs using HTML. Additionally, I feel comfortable linking between webpages both in a relative and absolute manner, I can add images to the site, and know how to assign meaning to bold (strong) and italics (emphasis) to paragraph elements.
